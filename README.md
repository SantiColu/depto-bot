# DeptoBot
A NodeJS scrapper bot that notifies you when a new apartment is listed. 

I wrote this to help a friend find an apartment, it's difficult to find something in La Plata...

`$ git clone https://github.com/SantiColu/depto-bot.git`

Run it :)

### Supported pages:
By now it only supports ZonaProp, i really don't know if i will add more...
